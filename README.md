## Overview

The Vanishing Hitchhiker is one of the most widespread and enduring urban legends worldwide. The archetypal story follows a consistent pattern: a driver picks up a hitchhiker (often a young woman), engages in conversation during which the passenger may provide an address or make predictions, then discovers the passenger has vanished from the vehicle.

In many versions, the hitchhiker leaves behind an item such as a sweater or scarf. When the driver visits the address provided, they learn the passenger died years ago, often in a car accident at or near the pickup location. The left-behind item is frequently discovered placed on the person's grave.

The legend has been extensively studied by folklorist **Jan Harold Brunvand** as an archetypal modern ghost story, representing themes of death, unfinished journeys, helping strangers, and the boundary between life and death.
