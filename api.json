      "summary": "A classic urban legend featuring a ghost hitchhiker who is picked up by a driver, converses during the ride, then mysteriously vanishes from the moving or stopped vehicle, often leaving behind an item that is later found on their grave.",
      "full": "The Vanishing Hitchhiker is one of the most widespread and enduring urban legends worldwide. The archetypal story follows a consistent pattern: a driver picks up a hitchhiker (often a young woman), engages in conversation during which the passenger may provide an address or make predictions, then discovers the passenger has vanished from the vehicle - either while still moving or after reaching the destination. In many versions, the hitchhiker leaves behind an item such as a sweater or scarf. When the driver visits the address provided, they learn the passenger died years ago, often in a car accident at or near the pickup location. The left-behind item is frequently discovered placed on the person's grave. Variations include the prophecy variant, where the hitchhiker warns of impending disaster before vanishing, and anniversary appearances, where the ghost appears on the anniversary of their death. Famous examples include Resurrection Mary in Chicago and numerous local versions worldwide. The legend has been extensively studied by folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand as an archetypal modern ghost story. It represents themes of death, unfinished journeys, helping strangers, and the transition from life to death. The Vanishing Hitchhiker has been a staple of urban legends since the automobile became common, with versions dating back to horse-and-buggy era phantom travelers, showing remarkable adaptability across cultures and time periods."
